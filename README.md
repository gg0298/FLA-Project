# FLA-Project
This project is a Python-based GUI application utilizing Tkinter, aimed at exploring fundamental principles of Push Down Automata (PDA) in string validation. Although PDAs are typically employed to parse context-free languages, this application simplifies PDA principles to check the presence of a substring within specific regions of a string. Itâ€™s an approachable implementation for understanding PDA concepts in language recognition and pattern matching, showcasing how strings can be validated based on positional constraints.
